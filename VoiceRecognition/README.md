# Project_MATLAB

This project is Year 2 Project of EE department in University of Liverpool, which is completed by five members. My contribution to this project is to lead & coordinate the group, to implement MATLAB code, to design GUI and to test the system.

This project aims to build a voice recognition software implemented in MATLAB. The main algorithms covered includes Voice Activity Detection (VAD), Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). More details refer to the project report. And the overall experimental recognition rate can reach 80%.
