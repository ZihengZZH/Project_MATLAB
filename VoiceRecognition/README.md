This project is Year 2 Project of EE department in Uni of Liverpool, which is completed by five members, including me.

This project aims to build a voice recognition software implemented in MATLAB. 
The main methods it takes are MFCC and DTW. 
The overall recognition rate can reach 80% as long as in a quiet environment.
